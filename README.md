# Inventary App

#What is inventary?

Inventory is the accounting of items, component parts and raw materials that a company either uses in production or sells.
As a business leader, you practice inventory management in order to ensure that you have enough stock on hand and to identify
when there's a shortage. The verb 'inventory' refers to the act of counting or listing items. As an accounting term, inventory 
is a current asset and refers to all stock in the various production stages. By keeping stock, both retailers and manufacturers
can continue to sell or build items. Inventory is a major asset on the balance sheet for most companies, however, too much inventory
can become a practical liability.
